# Dyscor
A WiP Go (golang) library with some helpful Discord utility stuff using (discordgo by bwmarrin). This hasn't been tested at all and major changes could be made due to being a WiP still.

## Packages
* ``utils`` - Simple utility functions.
* ``embed`` - A wrapper to build Discord embeds and complex embed using OOP. This is modfied version of Necroforger's code from [here](https://gist.github.com/Necroforger/8b0b70b1a69fa7828b8ad6387ebb3835)
* ``cmd`` - A wrapper to making Discord slash commands easier.
